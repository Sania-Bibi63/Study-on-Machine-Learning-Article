According to the NASA study, the worst drought happens in
the eastern Mediterranean that begin in 1998.In this research the drought
prediction is resolved using the SPI (Standardize Precipitation index), that
using the four-machine learning algorithm. Although there are many
machines learning algorithm, but in this article the author uses only for
algorithm. That are RF, RT, RSS, and BG. The author uses these
algorithms for the prediction of the drought. With the prediction, these
algorithms are also compared based on the Correlation, RMSE. After
comparing we came to know that the “Bagging Algorithm” is the best
among all of four. Because BG algorithm has high Corelation and low
RMSE.
